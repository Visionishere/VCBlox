# VCBlox
A extension that tells you if you are banned from using Roblox voice chat, and if so, HOW LONG!

All duck taped and smushed with spaghetti code by GPT4

Also, dont use this if your account is to young/age isnt verified. Duh.

## How to download/use?
https://dev.to/ben/how-to-install-chrome-extensions-manually-from-github-1612
Make sure you have cookies enabled and are logged into Roblox. Then click on the mic icon which will show a popup window telling you if you are banned or not.

## How does it work?
When you get suspended from VC access, Roblox will tell you NOTHING about *WHEN* you will get unsuspended. They will just tell you're suspended. Which is very annoying and can make people afraid they are suspended forever when they arent.

The solution, https://voice.roblox.com/v1/settings

This neat little API link has all the info about YOUR account's voice chat settings including if you're banned and if so, when you shall be unbanned.
But this solution isnt well known, and some people are to lazy to bother copying the "Seconds" number which is a unix time code, into a unix time code website.
So I thought, why dont I make GPT create a chrome extension that does this automatically and it worked!

## This is ugly
I know, but it works which is what's important

## This code sucks
Yes, its made by GPT and im open for pull requests
